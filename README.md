‚ö†Ô∏è Apify API Usage Limitations (Free Tier)
Note on Free Tier Limits:

Apify offers a free tier that allows you to run actors (such as the job scraping actor you're using) a limited number of times each month. Once your free runs are exhausted, you'll need to wait for the next month for more runs or upgrade to a paid plan to continue using Apify services.

üö® Free Plan Details:
The free tier typically allows a set number of actor executions (runs) per month. After those runs are used up, no additional runs will be allowed unless you upgrade to a paid subscription or wait until the next billing cycle.
You can check your usage stats and remaining runs in your Apify dashboard.
